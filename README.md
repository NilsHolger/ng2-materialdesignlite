# Angular 2 + Angular CLI + Material Design Lite

Form a harmonious couple. This is innovation future technology all the way. The CSS and design, innovation technology philosophy behind Material Design Lite is flabbergasting. I strongly encourage you to read this https://getmdl.io/ to understand what futuristic thinking and considerations and attention to detail where put into movement to create this beauty, many colors I even saw rainbow colors somewhere in the CSS and there was great joy. This is CSS for responsive, mobile, web, cloud, desktop applications, all Android applications in the future, that is in my eyes unparalleled and that gives Angular the clothing required to be dressed in pure beauty so that the world and all users who are not aware of what is happening behind the scenes, the awesome technologies involved are delighted when they are allowed to interact with an Angular application or even build an Angular application on planet earth and maybe in the future in the entire universe. It's been a long day, I know. But my honest appreciation of what Material Design Lite brings us. I will strongly encourage the Angular Team so that we provide a couple of starting pages that will delight the new users, so that everybody is happy and Angular continues to grow perpetually, moving aside all obstacles and threats that may appear and disappear on the way. It does not play a major role that all these innovative technologies come from the same house, all from Google, but I would encourage to use what is homemade, it just fits better together and synergies are formed that will have a beneficial impact on growth for the organization. Inspiration guided me to write down these couple of lines. I hope I don't get fired. :)
